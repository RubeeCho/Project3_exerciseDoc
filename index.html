          <h3>Overhead Shrug</h3>
          <p id="info">This exercise targets the upper traps, the shoulder blades and engages the upward rotation of the arms. When performing this exercise, you should be standing with the bar directly under the crown of the head. Make sure that your arm is not slanted in either directions, and that it is directly raised upward. Upon executing each repetition using your shoulder blades, focus on engaging the latissimus dorsi (lats of the back) especially on the way down.

          <h3>Standing Calf Raise</h3>
          <p id="info">This exercise targets the calfs and the forefoot. It allows for improved stability for later exercises. Do not rush this exercise but keep a calm pace througout the reps. </p>

          </p>

          <h3>Hanging Leg Raise</h3>
          <p id="info">This exercise targets the lower abdominal. It engages your core's stability and also helps prevent injuries. Not using the core to lower your legs will cause swinging so focus lowering your legs steadily bracing the lower abs.</p>

        <h3>Bench Press</h3>
          <p id="info">This exercise targets the pecs(chest), front shoulders and triceps. The preping position before managing weight: move up the chair to match your eyebrows with the bar, so that the two are aligned. Put your feet down so that all 3 points of your feet are grounded firmly to the ground (this is important), firmly pack your back and dig them into the chair so that your back only slightly arches. When moving the bar down aim to stop at your papillae in a diagnal trajectory rather than straight down and applying the same idea to push it back up. Try to feel your pecs stretching keeping the weight controled on the way down. Use leg drive simply by spreading them further apart for more power. You should be using thoracic breathing (chest), Inhale before you lower the barbell, lower the bar while keeping your breath held bracing your core, exhale as you push the bar back up.</p>

            <code>Reps: 6-8</code>

        <h3>Back Squat</h3>
          <p id="info">This exercise targets the quads, hamstrings, glutes, lower back, core and calves. Grip the bar as close together without feeling discomfort and keeping control of the bar by almost bending the bar with your hands. Tuck your elbows inward so that it is not flaring out (your wrist should be slightly bent backwards). Position your feet so that the inner part of your heels line up with your armpits and make sure to push your knees out in the same direction (often times exaggerating outwards) so that your knees don't cave in. Imagine pushing your knees forward but also pushing your glutes towards the back, stretching your hamstrings.Pay attention to you feet so that all three points are firmly grounded througout. Have your balance slightly forward when going down. Thrust your hips when you are fully up. You should be using diaphragmatic breathing (abdominal) Inhale before you lower the barbell, lower the bar while keeping your breath held bracing your core, exhale as you push the bar back up. </p>

          <h3>Conventional Deadlift</h3>
          <p id="info">This exercise targets the glutes, quads, hamstrings, lower back muscles and lats. Keep your grip positioned at shoulder width and avoid having them too close together. Keep the bar extremely close to your shins (have it nearly touching). Maintain a slightly forward center of gravity, paying attention to your toes that they are firmly planted on the ground along with the other 3 points of your feet. Engage your lats so that they are firmly packed (almost downward). To further ensure that the bar is as close to your legs as possible, imagine bending the bar when getting ready to ascend. A technique called "wedging" can assist in lifting where you perform a sudden movement where you straigten your knees and bend them back towards the bar, then simultaniously thrusting your hips to powerfully lift the bar. When you are lowering the bar, your hamstrings should be used thus the bar should be nearly touching your legs througout the decend. It is important to keep your lower back engaged at all times to prevent injury. You should be using diaphragmatic breathing (abdominal) Inhale before you lift the barbell, lift the bar while keeping your breath held bracing your core, and holding the same breath, lower the bar exhaling once the bar has hit the ground.</p>

Slightly leaning forward but keep your chest high. Tilt your glutes back and upward making sure that your knees are only slightly projecting out staying close to being vertical with your ankle. Extend forward but directly up (from the side, your hip should be moving in a diagonal movement). You dont need to stand up all the way, stop while the knee is still slightly bent. Keep your foot firmly planted so that you dont lose balance. Have the same hand with the leg your exercising on your hip, while holding the weight with the hand opposite of the working leg.</p>
