# Project3_exerciseDoc

This is a exercise documentation page inspired by the Barnes & Nobles webpage. 
It has a navigation bar that changes position from the left to top as the viewpage gets 
to a small enough size. I was able to achieve this with flex-box but chose to rewrite it using @media
after finding out about them. I also implemented the newly learned table element.
